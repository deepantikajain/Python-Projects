A simple console-based Snake–Water–Gun game built using Python, designed to practice core programming concepts in a fun way.

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Conditional statements (if-else) Loops User input handling Random module Basic game logic

The game allows the user to play against the computer, where:

Snake drinks Water
Water drowns Gun
Gun kills Snake
🔧 Technologies Used

Python 3
Random module
🚀 How to Run

Run the Python file using: python snake_water_gun.py

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project is part of my Python learning journey and focuses on building logic rather than UI. It’s a beginner-friendly game and a great starting point for understanding decision-making in programs.
